Edge detection
==============

A document edge / boundary detector using OpenCV 3 for image processing.  
Detects the boundaries of a document even when placed against a background of a similar colour.  
Uses prior knowledge of document features (coloured patterns) and geometry (pattern location) to estimate document edges.
